        <p class="one">For there's a man inside me, and only when he's finally out, can I walk free of pain. I've used one adjective to describe myself. What is it? I run a pretty tight ship around here. With a pool table. It's a gaming ship. I could use a leather jacket for when I'm on my hog and have to go into a controlled slide. Happy.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2 class="sec2">Section Two</h2>
        <p class="two">I was once called the worst audience participant Cirque du Soleil ever had. There's been a lot of lying in this family. And a lot of love! More lies. If you're suggesting I play favorites, you're wrong. I love all of my children equally. I don't care for Gob. What's next, Michael? Are you going to make dancing illegal? Is this the tiny town from Footloose? I hate the Wetlands. They're stupid and wet, and there are bugs everywhere, and I think I maced a crane. Happy Franklin Friday. Quicken! Premiere! The guy runs a prison, he can have any piece of ass he wants.</p>

      <li>
        <h2 class="sec3">Section Three</h2>
        <p class="three">And I am rock steady. No more dizzies. Oh yeah, the guy in the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. Come on!</p>
